        My Life With English
    </div>

    <div class="s paragraph">
        <p>I love English, before I was keen on Graphics, SQL, etc. I had been fervently learning new words, phrasal verbs, and idioms. In 2019 I participated in «<span class ='key-words'>The National Contest in English for Engineering Students</span>» at Bauman Moscow State Technical University and came <span class ='key-words'>3rd</span> which became <span class ='key-words'>the best result</span> for any Tambov university in the history of the contest. It was a challenge because the contest was meant to be for teams of three, whereas I was the only one representing my region due to health issues of my teammates. Regardless of this obstacle, I was able to complete the assignment alone without the help of any mentor, which is something other teams had the privilege to use. </p>

        <p>While at University professors in my department would always ask me to translate their <span class ='key-words'>academic papers</span> from Russian to English usually without crediting my work. However, in my final year I was included in the list of authors of a paper dedicated to distributed information systems, I translated the whole text. Check the link below. </p>

    <div class="s paragraph">
        <p>I enjoyed participating in Translation Contests, buckling down to texts of various types, be it fiction or news articles, always scoring a Top 3 placement. In one of my semesters, I was an <span class ='key-words'>interpreter</span> for foreign students during their lectures. A professor was explaining a new topic, while I was translating from Russian to English.</p>

        <p>There were numerous opportunities of public speaking. One of them is the International Youth Educational Forum «<span class ='key-words'>EcoGreen</span>» where students from multiple countries discussed environmental challenges. My topic was dedicated to laws adopted in 4 major countries aimed at tackling global warming. At the same time the presentation demonstrates my great PowerPoint skills. </p>
