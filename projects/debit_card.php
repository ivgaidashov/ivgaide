        MIR Supreme Card Design
    </div>

    <div class="s paragraph plsql">
        <p>In 2021 the bank I worked for was launching a new line of debit cards called «<span class ='key-words'>MIR Supreme</span>». Judging by its rates, targeted demographics, and generous bonus systema a clear concept was formed in my mind . It had to be sophisticated, luxurious and appealing to clients who liked to spend a lot. At the same time knowing well that the bank didn’t have branches across the country but rather offered its services at a regional level with a loyal customer base in the Tambov region. That’s why I decided to draw the image of a venerated governor, Gavriil Derzhavin, who ruled the town in the 18th century. He did a lot of great stuff, and is still remembered here, having a university and street named after him, multiple monuments. I used two primary colors, blurred images from the town on the background and its outline. </p>

        <p>To offer additional options to the top managers of the bank I also designed two extra concepts, where the one with the isometric text effect is appealing to the youth, and the one with <a href="https://unsplash.com/photos/3E3AVpvlpao" target="_blank">a crown</a> is for more conservative clients.</p>

        <p>Later I designed another mockup for a new card product. The concept was focused  on the Tambov region and its cultural and economic diversity. The town combines multi-faceted people, ideas, and various flows inside itself. This is where the bank meets the challenges along the way to help finance your visions.</p>
