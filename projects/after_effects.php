        <p>For my final project at University I designed and developed an <span class ='key-words'>Arduino</span>-based device which provided 2-factor authentication with a <span class ='key-words'>fingerprint scanner</span> and an <span class ='key-words'>SMS-module</span> sending out a one-time password to users. On top of creating the code, designing its case, writing the thesis, I thought it would be great to learn<span class ='key-words'> After Effect</span> from scratch to represent the core concepts of the device and showcase its features in an entertaining fashion. Looking back on it there are conspicuous flaws in the video but at the same time you can notice that the quality of the AE projects grows as the video goes on since I was learning more and more.  </p>
